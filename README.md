# Professional Development Independent Study- Spring 2023 
## Prof Knox and Prof State

### Introduction

The purpose of this professional development independent study is to develop skills that will be useful in the professional world. The specific implementation being use of the exercism.org C++ track to develop coding skills to complement the Data Structures class that I am currently taking that also uses the C++ language. 

### Personal Background

My background is a professional pilot with a degree in Aerospace Engineering in my third semester of the Applied Computer Science program at the University of Colorado. As such my coding background is limited to Python and C++ as part of the 1300 introduction class and some Python in application during Discrete Structures and Cognitive Science in the second semester. During this semester we are also using the Zybooks platform. 

### Getting Started With Exercism.org

Getting started with exercism I found it relatively easy to set up an account using my GitHub login. My first attempt at an exercise was the standard "Hello world" program which left me overconfident and ready to attempt the standard "leap year" program. I was immediately faced with different namespaces and  a ".h" file. Neither of which I had experienced before. Some googling and YouTube videos later I began to understand what namespaces are but still had little idea how to implement them. Exercism provides very little instruction other than asking for mentoring and the error codes provided by the automatic grading/checker. I decided to hold off a bit and focus on the zybook to catch up with class. Second week of zybook I was learning about classes so I began to reattempt the challenge. After about an hour of trial and error I was able to pass the "leap year" challenge and move on. I found writing code that would hopefully solve some of the errors, such as a bool function that only returned "true", allowed me to start to understand how to get an input tested and returned and cause the actual tests to run. I was still confused why when I would start with a function such as "bool is_leap_year(int year)" I would get an error because year was unexpected, that error went away when I deleted "year" but caused issues with actual variables in the code. Later I added "year" back in and the code worked with no issues. After two and a half weeks I have accomplished two challenges with no more meaningful understanding of interacting with the exercism code. On a positive side, this has given me challenges to bounce off of zybooks and I feel I'll have a much better understanding of both classes of and namespaces which can only serve me better in the future. 
The next challenge is calculating how many years 1000000 seconds is on different planets. Already I've hit the exact same wall I hit the first time. 

March 12 Update:

I've been very behind on updating progress of this project. I have completed a total of six exercises in exercism and am getting a little better at understanding the interface. The biggest breakthrough came when I finally processed that the errors I was seeing included errors from the testing code, not just my own. This simplified my troubleshooting. I found focussing on the basics the last few weeks with 2270, especially reattempting the practice coding tests for the midterm made my basic programming within functions significantly better. Things I missed is making sure I add things like "#include <string>" if I was working with strings in that exercise, basics that are generally already included in the 2270 projects. I still am having trouble with a few of the "easy" projects such as "space_time" that highlight weeknesses in my understanding of classes and give me an area to focus in zybooks. I am feeling more comfortable working in exercism and am planning on requesting mentoring this week on a couple of the exercises. I also noticed they have a "A Brief Introduction to C++" on the dashboard now so I will report back on if that is useful. 

One major lesson learned was I initially treated this site as something like zybooks that I should be able to do all inclusive. Instead, I now use exercises to guide my searches into difference functions, syntax, and features of C++ and where I need to refocus and review in zybooks.


Worked through the Triangle exercise. I was able to find other solutions and things I leard looking at their solutions: Declaring an "enum class" of flavor to create the results for equalateral, isosceles, scalene and including <stdexcept> to throw exceptions if any of the requirements of a triangle are violated after I created tests for them. Again, I'm curious how exercism expects me to learn these issues without any reference to other solutions or hints as to what to research. It's a bit frustrating. 

This [introduction](https://youtu.be/9RL8ZssWg5Q) to exercism C++ was added a few days ago and I wish it had existed the whole time. Gave some great resources and a coding demo that explained both the idea of improving in iteration and how much more efficient the "Reverse String" exercise could be solved. I guess part of my student mindset from 2270 is we are building the structures and algorithms as opposed to using built in which is probably making things more difficult than they should be. 

April 20th update:

Worked on the Class, Two_fer, and a few other problems. I learned a bit working through the Two_fer about overrides for functions. The ability to have a default value if no value is provided by the user. I feel like I understand it in this usage but not entirely sure I follow the syntax in a way I could use it elsewhere. I'm still struggling to understand reading the test files to understand what functions I need to write. This coming week I plan on working on using exercism through an editor on my computer so I get a bit better error explanations. It's especially frustrating when I can't get the program to run to get to the tests compared to what we've been doing in class where I generally find the answers easier to understand. Last week was spent studying for both the midterm and cranking through the graph homework due next week.
