# Professional Development Independent Study- Spring 2023 
## Prof Knox and Prof State

###Introduction

The purpose of this professional development independent study is to develop skills that will be useful in the professional world. The specific implementation being use of the exercism.org C++ track to develop coding skills to complement the Data Structures class that I am currently taking that also uses the C++ language. 

### Personal Background

My background is a professional pilot with a degree in Aerospace Engineering in my third semester of the Applied Computer Science program at the University of Colorado. As such my coding background is limited to Python and C++ as part of the 1300 introduction class and some Python in application during Discrete Structures and Cognitive Science in the second semester. During this semester we are also using the Zybooks platform. 

### Getting Started With Exercism.org

Getting started with exercism I found it relatively easy to set up an account using my GitHub login. My first attempt at an exercise was the standard "Hello world" program which left me overconfident and ready to attempt the standard "leap year" program. I was immediately faced with different namespaces and  a ".h" file. Neither of which I had experienced before. Some googling and YouTube videos later I began to understand what namespaces are but still had little idea how to implement them. Exercism provides very little instruction other than asking for mentoring and the error codes provided by the automatic grading/checker. I decided to hold off a bit and focus on the zybook to catch up with class. Second week of zybook I was learning about classes so I began to reattempt the challenge. After about an hour of trial and error I was able to pass the "leap year" challenge and move on. I found writing code that would hopefully solve some of the errors, such as a bool function that only returned "true", allowed me to start to understand how to get an input tested and returned and cause the actual tests to run. I was still confused why when I would start with a function such as "bool is_leap_year(int year)" I would get an error because year was unexpected, that error went away when I deleted "year" but caused issues with actual variables in the code. Later I added "year" back in and the code worked with no issues. After two and a half weeks I have accomplished two challenges with no more meaningful understanding of interacting with the exercism code. On a positive side, this has given me challenges to bounce off of zybooks and I feel I'll have a much better understanding of both classes of and namespaces which can only serve me better in the future. 
The next challenge is calculating how many years 1000000 seconds is on different planets. Already I've hit the exact same wall I hit the first time.
